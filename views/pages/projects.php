            ✅Data persistence in localstorage to maintain a record of patients.
            ✅Patient editing and deletion functionality, making it a truly useful tool for patient management in a clinic.
            To build this project, I used Vite for the initial files, React for creating the interface, and TailwindCSS to give it a nice look. I also implemented Hooks like useEffect and useState, which are essential in developing React applications.'
